Harvester
============

Harvester provisions the Pilot on compute resources using the relevant communication protocol
for each resource provider, and communicates with PanDA server on behalf of Pilot if it
runs on the limited environment where outbound network connectivity is missing.

The details of Harvester are described at `Harvester documentation page <https://github.com/HSF/harvester/wiki/Home>`_.

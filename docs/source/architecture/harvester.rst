Harvester
============

Harvester provisions the Pilot on computing resources using the relevant communication protocol
for each resource provider, and communicates with PanDA server on behalf of Pilot if it
runs on the limited environment where outbound network connectivity is missing.

Harvester is a common project that extends beyond PanDA.
The details of Harvester are described on `an external page <https://github.com/HSF/harvester/wiki/Home>`_.

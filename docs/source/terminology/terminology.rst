Task, Input, and Output
------------------------
A task is a unit of workload to accomplish an indivisible scientific objective.
If an objective is done in multiple steps each step is mapped to a task.
A task takes input and produces output. Generally input and output are collections
of data files but there are also other formats, such as groups of sequence numbers,
collections of metadata, notifications, void, and so on. Each task has a unique
identifier in the system.
